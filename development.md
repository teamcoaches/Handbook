# Development 
## Agile Methodology
The team uses an agile framework for developing the solution. We agree that the following are the agreed conventions on different concepts. In the best-case scenario, each sprint delivers a small product increment that functions, is QA-approved, and can be handed to stakeholders or end users to get their opinions.

**Sprint length:** 2 weeks 

### Scrum artifacts
Artifacts are development documents created by the team during development. It consists of two main parts:
- **Product backlog** Use cases defined from end user point of view. Anything that we want to explore is added here. The Product Owner is responsible to keep this document up to date. 
- **Sprint backlog** The sprint backlog contains requirement items that the team committed to complete during a given sprint. Sprint backlog items are sourced from the product backlog.

### Sprint Meetings
- **Sprint Planning** At the beginning of each sprint is held to decide how many user stories, use cases or other requirement items the team commits to. The purpose of this meeting is to take the top items from the backlog and estimate them assigning story points. Selected items are moved to the sprint backlog. Tasks must be assigned to last one or less per day for the duration of the sprint.

- **Daily Standup meetings** Every day the development team participates in a daily Standup meeting. The goal of this meeting is to discuss:
  - *What was done yesterday?*
  - *What is planned to be done today?*
  - *What are the issues and support required from others to solve some issue?*

- **Retrospective** This will be done before the planning meeting at the end of the sprint. The retrospective goal is to discuss what went wrong and what went well during the sprint to better align the project progression with goals. Constant collection of lesson learned are required to have a clear log of the issues/solutions

### Sprint Meetings schedule:
- **Sprint Retrospective** - 15 min with lesson learned written. Done on Monday after Sprint completed.
- **Sprint Planning** - 2 hour. Monday after sprint retrospective.
- **Daily:** Everyday, 15 minutes.

### How we will work
**JIRA:** in this tool we are all the use stories, bugs and task and we are as agile as possible where daily is defined the day and objective work to be completed.
In JIRA there is an active sprint where we are focusing on. The Active sprint can be updated daily as well adding new Tasks, bugs that are agreed that can be done during that time.

**Lists in JIRA:**
- *To Do:* A Card that will start soon (within the sprint which has dependencies of others)
- *In progress:* Someone is actually working on this task (we started but didnâ€™t finish all tasks)
- *Done:* We consider the Card is done and we have nothing more to do.
