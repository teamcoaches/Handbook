# Company Handbook

***Team Coaches*** has been created to make a change on the ways that operations are managed. We believe that operations should be easy and in your hands so you can focus on making decision with the data we provide.

This `handbook` is  used to make sure we all work in the same direction following our mission. We are idealistics. We love new things and change the status quo.

Enjoy and have fun while you work is our key objectives. 

This guide is an introduction to our way of working.

It is work on progress so please provide any feedback if you seen is necesary. I would [love to hear](mailto:diego@teamcoach.es) from you!!!

## Operation
We are meaninful while expressing ourself. We need to make sure that personal life goes first without impacting our business. \

### 1. Speak Up
This is something that you must know from the beginning. Everything needs to be told. We like to hear and undestand your problem respecting your privacy.
Meaning that if there are bad, good or really awful things that are wrong, we will listen.
We know that mistakes are what let us learn and improve so we are focus on making things happening going through every stone in the way.

### 2. Decisions
We need everyone to be accountable on their own decision. If there is a decision that needs to be made, we need to do it now.
We are small enough to know that if there is no speed we won't be hear tomorrow.

### 3. Look behind the person
Every person has his personal life. There are time that personal and work can't be differentiated, so be meaningful. Make sure that you understand the behavior that they are expressing and don't feel it personal.

### 4. Culture
People refers to company culture and culture fit too much. I am looking for cultural diversed company where people no matter race, creed, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, age, height, weight, physical or mental ability, veteran status, military obligations, and marital status can interact and make the best of this world.
We believe that if we have a diverse company, we can expect better results generated from different point of view. That allows us to focus in a global market and make the best innovation tools for all.

## Our story

We starts with a clear problem, change the way that innovation programs are managed and operated. After years of mentoring and coaching, innovation programs are getting to a point that they are ineficient to run if just using excel or even multiple tools.

Our vision is that every innovation program uses a set of tools in one platform to increase the success rate for startups and project being incubated.

To achieve that Team Coaches was built to be the entreprenership community platform for innovation programs.

Programs will be centralized in one platform that will help them to make decision quicker. That will reduce the waste and increase efficiency. (We estimate that at least 5 hours per week will be reduced by using our platform)

However the intension is also to help entrepreneur to start learning a productivity world making a simple approach to look for objectives, mentrics, initiatives and tasks.
