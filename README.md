# Company Handbook

***Team Coaches*** has been created to make a change on the ways that operations are managed. We believe that operations should be easy and in your hands so you can focus on making decision with the data we provide.

This `handbook` is  used to make sure we all work in the same direction following our mission. We are idealistics. We love new things and change the status quo.

Enjoy and have fun while you work is our key point. 

This guide is an introduction to our way of working.

It is work on progress so please provide any feedback if you seen is necesary.

## Operation
We are meaninful while expressing ourself. We need to make sure that personal life goes first without impacting our business. 

### 1. Speak Up
This is something that you must know from the beginning. Everything needs to be told. We like to hear and undestand your problem respecting your privacy.
Meaning that if there are bad, good or really awful things that are wrong, we will listen.
We know that mistakes are what let us learn and improve so we are focus on making things happening going through every stone in the way.

## 2. Decisions
We need everyone to be accountable on their own decision. If there is a decision that needs to be made, we need to do it now.
We are small enough to know that if there is no speed we won't be hear tomorrow.

## Team

**Diego - it is my fault** - [@diealvarado](https://twitter.com/diealvarado) [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvarado/)

Diego is the Product Owner, Sales guys, Operations and everything where there is no position established.

**Jesse - Development guru** [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-holden)

Jesse is in charge of development and deployment. He mainly focuses on the back-end (API/Databases/Docker) but also orchestrates larger front-end features.

## Development 
### Agile Methodology
The team uses an agile framework for developing the solution. We agree that the following are the agreed conventions on different concepts. In the best-case scenario, each sprint delivers a small product increment that functions, is QA-approved, and can be handed to stakeholders or end users to get their opinions.

**Sprint length:** 2 weeks 

#### Scrum artifacts
Artifacts are development documents created by the team during development. It consists of two main parts:
- **Product backlog** Use cases defined from end user point of view. Anything that we want to explore is added here. The Product Owner is responsible to keep this document up to date. 
- **Sprint backlog** The sprint backlog contains requirement items that the team committed to complete during a given sprint. Sprint backlog items are sourced from the product backlog.

#### Sprint Meetings
- **Sprint Planning** At the beginning of each sprint is held to decide how many user stories, use cases or other requirement items the team commits to. The purpose of this meeting is to take the top items from the backlog and estimate them assigning story points. Selected items are moved to the sprint backlog. Tasks must be assigned to last one or less per day for the duration of the sprint.

- **Daily Standup meetings** Every day the development team participates in a daily Standup meeting. The goal of this meeting is to discuss:
  - *What was done yesterday?*
  - *What is planned to be done today?*
  - *What are the issues and support required from others to solve some issue?*

- **Retrospective** This will be done before the planning meeting at the end of the sprint. The retrospective goal is to discuss what went wrong and what went well during the sprint to better align the project progression with goals. Constant collection of lesson learned are required to have a clear log of the issues/solutions

#### Sprint Meetings schedule:
**Sprint Retrospective** - 15 min with lesson learned written. Done on Monday after Sprint completed.
**Sprint Planning** - 2 hour. Monday after sprint retrospective.
**Daily:** Everyday, 15 minutes.

#### How we will work
**JIRA:** in this tool we are all the use stories, bugs and task and we are as agile as possible where daily is defined the day and objective work to be completed.
In JIRA there are active sprint that is working on and that is what we need to put our focus on. The Active sprint can be updated daily as well adding new Tasks, bugs that are agreed that can be done during that time.

**Lists in JIRA:**
- *To Do:* A Card that will start soon (within the sprint which has dependencies of others)
- *In progress:* We are actually working on this task (we started but didnâ€™t finish all tasks)
- *Done:* We consider the Card is done and we have nothing more to do.

#### Tools:
- **Slack:** our daily communication tool.
- **Zoom or hangout:** All of our meetings are done through Zoom as it is the best in the industry for remote calls.
- **Email:** For communicating with other people outside the organization.
- **Google Drive:** Where we are going to save all of the documents that we are working on. 
- **JIRA:** use cases, tasks and bugs are reported here.
- **Github:** All of our repository is located on Github. We must upload the code to this repository to be considered done. We expect github to be up to date.
